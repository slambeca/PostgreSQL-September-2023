# Course details

Databases are the standard way of using dynamic information in modern technology, making them an indispensable part of almost every application. The intensive database fundamentals course will introduce students to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - PostgreSQL. The course gives serious attention to the relational model, ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Fundamental knowledge of working with functions, procedures, transactions, and triggers is provided. This course lays the foundations of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and to understand concepts such as converting a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
